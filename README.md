# Meals-App

Hello.

This project is based on FreeCodeCamp's Youtube video which called "React JavaScript Framework for Beginners â€“ Project-Based Course".

Changes that I made;

  -Changed like button
  -Added dark theme
  -Added dark theme toggler
  -Added loading gif
  -Like button changes to dislike if meal is in the Favorites array
  -Dislike button also removes the meal if the meal is in the Favorites array
  -Changed preventDefault function from form element to re-render the page. This was needed since after clicking "Suprise me" button only one meal is rendered. There was no going back.

Original project is created in www.replit.com so I couldn't do pull request.
